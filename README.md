I try to implement a c++ procedure according to the following flowchart but meet lots of errors. Most of them due to undeclear of varables like Xsig_aug, Xsig_pred etc.

Then I revised the the first-try code. Now there is no compile error. But I got error: "libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::domain_error: type must be string, but is null" when I run it.

I will continue tommorow sometime.
